            //Afterwards give the user the information about the game and make the user guess the word until the value is guessed or user types STOP. 
            //In this task use only lower case string values and don’t use any latvian/russian special characters. 
            //Firstly print the hidden words first letter and all the rest symbols print as stars. 
            //For example, if the word to guess would be “pulse”, then at the beginning of the game user sees - “p****”. 
            //User tries to guess the word and after each guess user gets the current progress. 
            //If the user guesses a correct letter IN THE RIGHT POSITION then continue to print all the known letters. 
            //For example, if a another users guess is “plane”, then continue to print “p***e” and so on until all the letters are guessed. 
            //The guessed letters print in green color. If the user wins then write an appropriate message. Game ends when the user has guessed the word or he writes STOP. 
            //User can only input words with 5 letters or the word STOP, if something else is inputted then show an error message.
